# EER-in-WSN
We prepare a routing method which makes the sensors to load the data from sender to the receiver by using energy efficiently, as it uses cluster head formation in LEACH protocol. The sink which is a receiver moves from one place to another place randomly throughout the range.

Here initially, the sensor nodes are created randomly in the given range and same energy:

-After some rounds, the energy of the sensors changes and then the cluster heads are elected as per that energy
-The dead nodes are represented in red color:

- After this we display the graphs of the performance of the sensors taken.
-We also mainatin the characteristics of the nodes like resisual energy, cluster head, distance between clusterhead and sink in a table :

We can draw the result analysis comparing between existing and our proposed system in 2 factors like life time and average energy consumption:
